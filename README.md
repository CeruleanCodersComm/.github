## How does this work?

GitHub will use and display default files for any of our repo that does not have its own file of that type.

Like if a repo in our org, doesn't have a code of conduct, it will inherit from this repo.

You may call this repo as a fallback.

For more information, please see the article on [creating a default community health file for your organization](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-default-community-health-file-for-your-organization).
